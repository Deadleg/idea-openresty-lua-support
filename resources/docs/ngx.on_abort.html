<p><strong>syntax:</strong> <em>ok, err = ngx.on_abort(callback)</em></p>
<p><strong>context:</strong> <em>rewrite_by_lua&#42;, access_by_lua&#42;, content_by_lua&#42;</em></p>
<p>Registers a user Lua function as the callback which gets called automatically when the client closes the (downstream) connection prematurely.</p>
<p>Returns <code>1</code> if the callback is registered successfully or returns <code>nil</code> and a string describing the error otherwise.</p>
<p>All the <a href="#nginx-api-for-lua">Nginx API for Lua</a> can be used in the callback function because the function is run in a special "light thread", just as those "light threads" created by <a href="#ngxthreadspawn">ngx.thread.spawn</a>.</p>
<p>The callback function can decide what to do with the client abortion event all by itself. For example, it can simply ignore the event by doing nothing and the current Lua request handler will continue executing without interruptions. And the callback function can also decide to terminate everything by calling <a href="#ngxexit">ngx.exit</a>, for example,</p>
<p>```lua</p>
<p>local function my_cleanup()  -- custom cleanup work goes here, like cancelling a pending DB transaction</p>
<pre><code> -- now abort all the &quot;light threads&quot; running in the current request handler
 ngx.exit(499)
</code></pre>
<p>end</p>
<p>local ok, err = ngx.on_abort(my_cleanup)  if not ok then  ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "failed to register the on_abort callback: ", err)  ngx.exit(500)  end ```</p>
<p>When <a href="#lua_check_client_abort">lua_check_client_abort</a> is set to <code>off</code> (which is the default), then this function call will always return the error message "lua_check_client_abort is off".</p>
<p>According to the current implementation, this function can only be called once in a single request handler; subsequent calls will return the error message "duplicate call".</p>
<p>This API was first introduced in the <code>v0.7.4</code> release.</p>
