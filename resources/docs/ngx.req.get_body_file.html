<p><strong>syntax:</strong> <em>file_name = ngx.req.get_body_file()</em></p>
<p><strong>context:</strong> <em>rewrite_by_lua&#42;, access_by_lua&#42;, content_by_lua&#42;</em></p>
<p>Retrieves the file name for the in-file request body data. Returns <code>nil</code> if the request body has not been read or has been read into memory.</p>
<p>The returned file is read only and is usually cleaned up by Nginx's memory pool. It should not be manually modified, renamed, or removed in Lua code.</p>
<p>If the request body has not been read yet, call <a href="#ngxreqread_body">ngx.req.read_body</a> first (or turn on <a href="#lua_need_request_body">lua_need_request_body</a> to force this module to read the request body. This is not recommended however).</p>
<p>If the request body has been read into memory, try calling the <a href="#ngxreqget_body_data">ngx.req.get_body_data</a> function instead.</p>
<p>To force in-file request bodies, try turning on <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_body_in_file_only">client_body_in_file_only</a>.</p>
<p>This function was first introduced in the <code>v0.3.1rc17</code> release.</p>
