<p><strong>syntax:</strong> <em>keys = ngx.shared.DICT:get_keys(max_count?)</em></p>
<p><strong>context:</strong> <em>init_by_lua&#42;, set_by_lua&#42;, rewrite_by_lua&#42;, access_by_lua&#42;, content_by_lua&#42;, header_filter_by_lua&#42;, body_filter_by_lua&#42;, log_by_lua&#42;, ngx.timer.&#42;, balancer_by_lua&#42;, ssl_certificate_by_lua&#42;, ssl_session_fetch_by_lua&#42;, ssl_session_store_by_lua&#42;</em></p>
<p>Fetch a list of the keys from the dictionary, up to <code>&lt;max_count&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>By default, only the first 1024 keys (if any) are returned. When the <code>&lt;max_count&gt;</code> argument is given the value <code>0</code>, then all the keys will be returned even there is more than 1024 keys in the dictionary.</p>
<p><strong>CAUTION</strong> Avoid calling this method on dictionaries with a very large number of keys as it may lock the dictionary for significant amount of time and block Nginx worker processes trying to access the dictionary.</p>
<p>This feature was first introduced in the <code>v0.7.3</code> release.</p>
