Returns a true value when successful or <code>nil</code> and a string describing the error otherwise.</p><p>According to the current implementation, only the parent coroutine (or "light thread") can kill a thread. Also, a running "light thread" with pending NGINX subrequests (initiated by <a href="#ngxlocationcapture">ngx.location.capture</a> for example) cannot be killed due to a limitation in the NGINX core.</p><p>This API was first enabled in the <code>v0.9.9</code> release.</p>
