  <li>both the "entry thread" and all the user "light threads" terminates,</li>
  <li>a "light thread" (either the "entry thread" or a user "light thread" aborts by calling <a href="#ngxexit">ngx.exit</a>, <a href="#ngxexec">ngx.exec</a>, <a href="#ngxredirect">ngx.redirect</a>, or <a href="#ngxreqset_uri">ngx.req.set_uri(uri, true)</a>, or</li>

</ol><p>When the user "light thread" terminates with a Lua error, however, it will not abort other running "light threads" like the "entry thread" does.</p><p>Due to the limitation in the Nginx subrequest model, it is not allowed to abort a running Nginx subrequest in general. So it is also prohibited to abort a running "light thread" that is pending on one ore more Nginx subrequests. You must call <a href="#ngxthreadwait">ngx.thread.wait</a> to wait for those "light thread" to terminate before quitting the "world". A notable exception here is that you can abort pending subrequests by calling <a href="#ngxexit">ngx.exit</a> with and only with the status code <code>ngx.ERROR</code> (-1), <code>408</code>, <code>444</code>, or <code>499</code>.</p><p>The "light threads" are not scheduled in a pre-emptive way.

<ol>
  <li>a (nonblocking) I/O operation cannot be completed in a single run,</li>
  <li>it calls <a href="#coroutineyield">coroutine.yield</a> to actively give up execution, or</li>

</ol><p>For the first two cases, the "light thread" will usually be resumed later by the ngx_lua scheduler unless a "stop-the-world" event happens.</p><p>User "light threads" can create "light threads" themselves. And normal user coroutines created by <a href="#coroutinecreate">coroutine.create</a> can also create "light threads". The coroutine (be it a normal Lua coroutine or a "light thread") that directly spawns the "light thread" is called the "parent coroutine" for the "light thread" newly spawned.</p><p>The "parent coroutine" can call <a href="#ngxthreadwait">ngx.thread.wait</a> to wait on the termination of its child "light thread".</p><p>You can call coroutine.status() and coroutine.yield() on the "light thread" coroutines.</p><p>The status of the "light thread" coroutine can be "zombie" if</p>
<ol>
  <li>the current "light thread" already terminates (either successfully or with an error),</li>
  <li>its parent coroutine is still alive, and</li>
  <li>its parent coroutine is not waiting on it with <a href="#ngxthreadwait">ngx.thread.wait</a>.</li>
</ol><p>The following example demonstrates the use of coroutine.yield() in the "light thread" coroutines to do manual time-slicing:</p><p>```lua</p><p>local yield = coroutine.yield</p><p>function f()  local self = coroutine.running()  ngx.say("f 1")  yield(self)  ngx.say("f 2")  yield(self)  ngx.say("f 3")  end</p><p>local self = coroutine.running()  ngx.say("0")  yield(self)</p><p>ngx.say("1")  ngx.thread.spawn(f)</p><p>ngx.say("2")  yield(self)</p><p>ngx.say("3")  yield(self)</p><p>ngx.say("4") ```</p><p>Then it will generate the output</p>

The following example demonstrates parallel requests to MySQL, Memcached, and upstream HTTP services in a single Lua handler, and outputting the results in the order that they actually return (similar to Facebook's BigPipe model):</p><p>```lua</p><p>-- query mysql, memcached, and a remote http service at the same time,  -- output the results in the order that they  -- actually return the results.</p><p>local mysql = require "resty.mysql"  local memcached = require "resty.memcached"</p><p>local function query_mysql()  local db = mysql:new()  db:connect{  host = "127.0.0.1",  port = 3306,  database = "test",  user = "monty",  password = "mypass"  }  local res, err, errno, sqlstate =  db:query("select * from cats order by id asc")  db:set_keepalive(0, 100)  ngx.say("mysql done: ", cjson.encode(res))  end</p><p>local function query_memcached()  local memc = memcached:new()  memc:connect("127.0.0.1", 11211)  local res, err = memc:get("some_key")  ngx.say("memcached done: ", res)  end</p><p>local function query_http()  local res = ngx.location.capture("/my-http-proxy")  ngx.say("http done: ", res.body)  end</p><p>ngx.thread.spawn(query_mysql) -- create thread 1  ngx.thread.spawn(query_memcached) -- create thread 2  ngx.thread.spawn(query_http) -- create thread 3 ```</p><p>This API was first enabled in the <code>v0.7.0</code> release.</p>
